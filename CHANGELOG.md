## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-30

### Added

- **Six data primitives**: KV Store, Event Log, State Cell, JSON Store, Vector Store, Run
- **Value type system**: 8-variant `Value` enum (Null, Bool, Int, Float, String, Bytes, Array, Object) with strict typing rules
- **Run-based data isolation**: git-like branches for isolating agent sessions and experiments
- **OCC transactions**: optimistic concurrency control with snapshot isolation and read-your-writes semantics via the `Session` API
- **Three durability modes**: None, Buffered (default), and Strict
- **Write-ahead log (WAL)**: CRC32-checked entries for crash recovery
- **Snapshots**: periodic full-state captures for bounded recovery time
- **Run bundles**: export/import runs as portable `.runbundle.tar.zst` archives
- **Hybrid search**: BM25 keyword scoring with Reciprocal Rank Fusion across primitives
- **Vector store**: collection management, similarity search (Cosine, Euclidean, DotProduct), metadata support
- **JSON store**: path-level reads and writes with cursor-based pagination
- **Versioned reads**: `getv()`/`readv()` API for version history access
- **Typed Strata API**: high-level Rust API with `Into<Value>` ergonomics
- **Command/Output enums**: serializable instruction set for SDK builders
- **7-crate workspace**: core, storage, concurrency, durability, engine, intelligence, executor
