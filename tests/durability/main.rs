//! Integration tests for the durability layer.
//!
//! These tests exercise WAL, snapshot, and recovery behaviors at the
//! Database level — things that cannot be tested in unit tests because
//! they require a real Database lifecycle (open → write → close → reopen).
//!
//! Unit tests (234 in crates/durability/src/) cover encoding, decoding,
//! corruption detection, and replay logic in isolation. These integration
//! tests cover the end-to-end guarantees.
