//! Transaction validation for OCC
//!
//! This module implements conflict detection per Section 3 of
//! `docs/architecture/M2_TRANSACTION_SEMANTICS.md`.
//!
//! Key rules from the spec:
//! - First-committer-wins based on READ-SET, not write-set
//! - Blind writes (write without read) do NOT conflict
//! - CAS is validated separately from read-set
//! - Write skew is ALLOWED (do not try to prevent it)
